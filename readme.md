a c++ project to display input values by the user and display them back on the console showing the multiplication, addition subtraction and also division , 
Ratio ...although finding the ratio of the inputs is still pending!!😔




# Requirements

  * g++ v5.4 or newer
  * Boost 1.58.0 or newer
    * The `boost/multiprecision/float128.hpp` header must be available
  * Make

## Installed Boost Packages

For development the following boost packages were installed.

```
libboost-date-time1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed]
libboost-filesystem1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed]
libboost-iostreams1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed]
libboost-python1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
libboost-regex1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
libboost-system1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed]
libboost-test-dev/xenial,now 1.58.0.1ubuntu1 amd64 [installed]
libboost-test1.58-dev/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
libboost-test1.58.0/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
libboost1.58-dev/xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 amd64 [installed,automatic]
libboost1.58-doc/xenial-updates,xenial-updates,now 1.58.0+dfsg-5ubuntu3.1 all [installed]
```

This listing was obtained by running `apt list --installed | grep boost`.


# Compilation

The code can be compiled with the provided makefile using the standard `make`
command.

If compiling the code manually, or integrating into a larger program, include
the following flags:

```
FLAGS=-std=c++17 -fsanitize=address -fuse-ld=gold -Wall -MMD \
      -fext-numeric-literals -lquadmath #-O3
```

Note that flag `-fuse-ld=gold` is only required on certain Ubuntu systems due
to a know bug with g++ 5.x.


# Sample Execution & Output

If run without command line arguments, using

```
./precisionEstimate
```

the following usage message will be displayed.

```
Usage: ./precisionEstimate numExecs
```

If run using 

```
./precisionEstimate 100000000
```

output *simliar* to

```
   0 secs | 1.19209e-07
   1 secs | 2.22045e-16
  17 secs | 1.92593e-34
```

will  be displayed. Note that the precision estimates will vary by
architecture/system.


/*Note that the program is not yet complete ....this is a reminder that you should enback on it to complete the ratio part or find the ratio 
		
		
		of the intergers a user input and also be in a position to display to him or her
		suggested solution ... first find the gcd and then divide the gcd with each values both value 1 and value 2 and display them
		    --and to find the gcd you have to find the factors of each values both value 1 and 2 and then check for the repeated and similar values and then multiply them to get the gcd
